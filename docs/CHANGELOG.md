# Changelog

## 0.2.2 — 21 August 2026

Phase 2 reached the pre-host recorder checkpoint. The phase remains open pending the required genuine 24-hour always-on soak test.

Verified on commit `cf85c9139cfd887188bb10b60d6a75cf98e0e389`:

- CI passed with 74 automated tests and Ruff clean;
- live recorder smoke passed against Polymarket, Bybit spot, Bybit perpetual, and Coinbase spot;
- PostgreSQL-backed short soak passed with 17,506 live events and no health failures;
- Polymarket book snapshot timestamps are preserved in raw payloads without being misclassified as transport clock-skew evidence;
- Coinbase secondary feed uses ticker/top-of-book plus market trades and heartbeats, while Bybit remains the primary deep-book source;
- SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL connections use the installed psycopg v3 driver;
- secure always-on Ubuntu deployment assets were added;
- production PostgreSQL is bound to localhost only;
- the recorder runs as a dedicated unprivileged systemd user without Docker-socket access;
- host NTP synchronization remains required;
- CI validates deployment shell syntax and production Docker Compose configuration;
- a formal 24-hour soak report command and protected evidence location are documented.

Sanitized pre-host evidence is stored in `docs/evidence/phase-2-prehost-short-soak.json`; operator instructions are in `docs/PHASE-2-DEPLOYMENT.md`.

No model training, paper trading, or live trading has been added. `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` remains false and Phase 3 must not begin until the actual 24-hour Phase 2 host gate is passed and documented.

## 0.2.1 — 20 August 2026

Phase 1 market discovery closed and Phase 2 opened.

Verified:

- GitHub Actions successfully queried live Polymarket Gamma;
- authentic 5m and 15m market payloads were captured in-repo;
- live payloads confirmed real condition/event/CLOB token IDs and current Chainlink BTC/USD 60-second TWAP rule metadata;
- focused unit fixtures were replaced with authentic captured values;
- 15 local tests pass against the authentic fixture shapes;
- compile and safe `RESEARCH` health checks pass.

No model, paper trading, or live trading has been added. Phase 2 is the 24/7 raw recorder.

## 0.2.0 — 20 August 2026

Phase 1 market-discovery implementation prepared.

Added:

- official Gamma `GET /markets/slug/{slug}` client;
- deterministic UTC-aligned BTC 5m/15m recurring slug discovery;
- strict Gamma market parser and Up/Down token-label mapping;
- per-market resolution-source/rules fingerprinting;
- normalized `polymarket_markets` schema, PostgreSQL migration, and repository;
- rule-change guard for an existing condition;
- live Gamma smoke workflow/artifact capture for network-enabled GitHub Actions;
- Phase 1 parser, client, discovery, storage, and service tests.

Corrected source-of-truth resolution details after verifying that current short BTC markets use the Chainlink BTC/USD 60-second TWAP stream while older examples used a different Chainlink rule version.

Phase 1 remains open until the live Gamma smoke succeeds and authentic live response fixtures are inspected. No model, paper trading, or live trading has been added.

## 0.1.1 — 20 August 2026

Phase 0 repository bootstrap completed locally and prepared for repository publication.

Added:

- Python 3.12+ project configuration;
- safe runtime defaults for Research/Paper/Live modes;
- active 5m/15m and optional 10m horizon configuration;
- machine-readable health command;
- JSON logging foundation;
- PostgreSQL 16 Docker Compose development service;
- `.env.example` and secret-safe `.gitignore`;
- pytest + Ruff development tooling;
- GitHub Actions CI;
- source-of-truth and project handoff documentation;
- Phase 0 implementation plan.

No market collector, prediction model, paper execution, or live trading code exists yet.

## 0.1.0 — 20 August 2026

Initial project/source-of-truth freeze.
