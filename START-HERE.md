## Current next step

Phase 14 Live Readiness engineering remains research-only and the Master live gate remains blocked. Phase 15 is **not permitted**. Safety remains `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=false`, real trade-size and daily-loss limits remain zero, and automatic promotion remains false.

The active research direction remains the separately versioned **BTC-first V3 challenger**:

```text
feature_version = core-v3-btc-native
label_version   = official-outcome-v1
horizon_seconds = 300
feature_offsets = 60, 120, 180, 240
```

V3 forecasting uses BTC-native Coinbase/Bybit state. Polymarket price/book data remains the downstream executable benchmark/price-to-beat and is not a V3 forecast predictor. Existing V1/V2 evidence remains immutable.

### Historical Gate A acceptance

V3 Gate A remains accepted **PASS**. Sanitized production evidence is frozen at `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-gate-a-production-20260913.json`. It covers 17 markets / 68 immutable V3 rows beginning at `2026-09-13T13:45:00Z`, with coverage hash `32c283a7769681ebe5b2e0d1fe255ad6c38aa5b0301303f8fe86f4e7b2278ffb`, zero future-cutoff violations, zero Polymarket predictor keys, and complete current-state availability for Coinbase, Bybit spot, and Bybit linear. No model training or activation occurred as part of that acceptance.

The historical Gate B v1 preregistration design was approved at commit `c9e179c91ea990ca4a25a13f69fc5932811fb32a` and froze the original epoch ending `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z`. That historical evidence remains immutable even though v1 is now retired for policy-selection execution.

### Gate B v1 is retired for policy selection

The historical `v3-gate-b-preregister-v1` contract froze epoch `2026-09-13T13:45:00Z` through `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z` and required separate hash-bound `diagnosis` and `consumed_v2_final_holdout` exclusion manifests.

The exact 84-trade diagnosis identities were not durably frozen before that epoch began. Repository and host-side recovery found the diagnosis methodology but not a valid exact identity list, cohort hash, or replay-safe snapshot. Do not reconstruct the cohort from current database state, later settlements, outcomes, inferred timestamps, approximate date windows, or a synthetic/empty manifest.

Therefore `v3-gate-b-preregister-v1` is **non-executable for model/policy selection**. Do not run its readiness or planning path. Data from its `2026-09-13T13:45:00Z` to `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z` epoch may be retained only as immutable engineering, source-availability, leakage, and coverage evidence.

The complete consumed-V2 final-holdout contamination boundary has separately been recovered as 48 unique historical condition IDs with zero overlap across the two consumed plans. Those identities remain permanently non-reusable historical contamination evidence.

### Approved Gate B successor

The approved successor design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration.md`, with durable decision evidence at `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration-20260914.json`.

Its exact identity is:

```text
research_plan_version = v3-gate-b-preregister-v2
dataset_version       = supervised-core-v3-btc-native-v1
feature_version       = core-v3-btc-native
label_version         = official-outcome-v1
epoch_start           = 2026-09-16T13:45:00Z
epoch_end             = 2026-09-19T13:45:00Z
```

The successor preserves the v1 predictor set, model candidates, calibration/economic search rules, 24h/6h/6h/6h train-validation-test-step geometry, exactly five ordinary folds, one-market embargo, and final 12h reserved holdout.

Its contamination boundary is structural: only markets with `market_start_at >= epoch_start AND market_start_at < epoch_end` may participate. Every pre-epoch market is ineligible for successor train/validation/test/final-holdout membership. Historical diagnosis and consumed-V2 identities remain evidence but are not successor runtime selection inputs.

Readiness remains outcome-blind and planning remains feature-only/read-only. The successor preregistration authorizes neither model fitting nor final-holdout access.

### Successor runtime implementation checkpoint

The repository implementation of `v3-gate-b-preregister-v2` is complete at runtime checkpoint `659d9524fe8bfeba182b7cf7c8d9b664280f7562`. Exact-head CI run `34841954823` passed the full suite, deployment-asset validation, research-mode health check, and dashboard checks. The runtime removes historical exclusion manifests from successor readiness/plan APIs and CLI, while preserving the structural half-open epoch boundary, outcome-blind readiness, feature-only planning, PostgreSQL read-only transactions, no-clobber plan output, and the frozen search/economic contract.

This checkpoint is repository-only. It did not run readiness or planning against production, inspect successor outcomes/labels, fit models, access/evaluate the final holdout, activate a model/paper policy, mutate production, enable live trading, or change money limits.

## Immediate next task

The separately versioned V4 regime-aware feature implementation is complete. Production **feature materialization and collection** is now explicitly authorized, limited to research-mode immutable V4 feature rows.

The prospective V4 collection boundary is frozen at the V4 merge time:

```text
feature_version = core-v4-regime-aware
epoch_start     = 2026-09-20T12:40:53Z
horizon         = 300 seconds
offsets         = 60, 120, 180, 240 seconds
```

Only completed 5-minute markets with `market_start_at >= 2026-09-20T12:40:53Z` may be materialized by this collector. Existing immutable rows are preserved on rerun.

The production collector must run from an isolated versioned runtime under `/var/lib/bp/runtime`, reuse the existing production Python environment, leave the deployed `/opt/bp` checkout unchanged, and not restart `bp-recorder.service`.

This authorization does **not** include V4 model training, calibration, threshold search, Gate B planning, final-holdout construction/access, paper activation, automatic promotion, Phase 15, live trading, geographic bypass, or nonzero money limits.

After exact-head CI passes, install and verify the isolated V4 collector, enable its one-minute timer, write durable rollout evidence, and stop at the next research boundary.
