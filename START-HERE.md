# START HERE

This folder is the handoff pack for the **BTC Polymarket Prediction Engine**.

If you are opening a new ChatGPT/Codex chat, upload/add this pack to the project and say:

> Read `docs/MASTER-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.json`, `docs/BUILD-ORDER.md`, `docs/DECISION-LOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-phase-14-btc-first-v3-challenger-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration.md`, `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-preregistration-handoff-20260913.json`, and `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration-20260914.json`. Continue the project from the current phase. Do not redesign or restart it from memory unless the source of truth explicitly requires a change.

## Current next step

Phase 14 Live Readiness engineering remains research-only and the Master live gate remains blocked. Phase 15 is **not permitted**. Safety remains `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=false`, real trade-size and daily-loss limits remain zero, and automatic promotion remains false.

The active research direction remains the separately versioned **BTC-first V3 challenger**:

```text
feature_version = core-v3-btc-native
label_version   = official-outcome-v1
horizon_seconds = 300
feature_offsets = 60, 120, 180, 240
```

V3 forecasting uses BTC-native Coinbase/Bybit state. Polymarket price/book data remains the downstream executable benchmark/price-to-beat and is not a V3 forecast predictor. Existing V1/V2 evidence remains immutable.

V3 Gate A is accepted PASS. Sanitized production evidence remains `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-gate-a-production-20260913.json`; no model training or activation was performed by Gate A.

### Gate B v1 is retired for policy selection

The historical `v3-gate-b-preregister-v1` contract froze epoch `2026-09-13T13:45:00Z` through `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z` and required separate hash-bound `diagnosis` and `consumed_v2_final_holdout` exclusion manifests.

The exact 84-trade diagnosis identities were not durably frozen before that epoch began. Repository and host-side recovery found the diagnosis methodology but not a valid exact identity list, cohort hash, or replay-safe snapshot. Do not reconstruct the cohort from current database state, later settlements, outcomes, inferred timestamps, approximate date windows, or a synthetic/empty manifest.

Therefore `v3-gate-b-preregister-v1` is **non-executable for model/policy selection**. Do not run its readiness or planning path. Data from its `2026-09-13T13:45:00Z` to `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z` epoch may be retained only as immutable engineering, source-availability, leakage, and coverage evidence.

The complete consumed-V2 final-holdout contamination boundary has separately been recovered as 48 unique historical condition IDs with zero overlap across the two consumed plans. Those identities remain permanently non-reusable historical contamination evidence.

### Approved Gate B successor

The approved successor design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration.md`, with durable decision evidence at `docs/evidence/phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration-20260914.json`.

Its exact identity is:

```text
research_plan_version = v3-gate-b-preregister-v2
dataset_version       = supervised-core-v3-btc-native-v1
feature_version       = core-v3-btc-native
label_version         = official-outcome-v1
epoch_start           = 2026-09-16T13:45:00Z
epoch_end             = 2026-09-19T13:45:00Z
```

The successor preserves the v1 predictor set, model candidates, calibration/economic search rules, 24h/6h/6h/6h train-validation-test-step geometry, exactly five ordinary folds, one-market embargo, and final 12h reserved holdout.

Its contamination boundary is structural: only markets with `market_start_at >= epoch_start AND market_start_at < epoch_end` may participate. Every pre-epoch market is ineligible for successor train/validation/test/final-holdout membership. Historical diagnosis and consumed-V2 identities remain evidence but are not successor runtime selection inputs.

Readiness remains outcome-blind and planning remains feature-only/read-only. The successor preregistration authorizes neither model fitting nor final-holdout access.

## Immediate next task

**Implement `v3-gate-b-preregister-v2` in the repository before `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z`**, following `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-14-phase-14-v3-gate-b-successor-preregistration.md`.

Do not run v1 readiness or planning. Do not run successor readiness before the successor epoch closes at `2026-09-19T13:45:00Z`. During implementation, preserve outcome-blind readiness, feature-only planning, read-only database transactions, no-clobber plan output, and the unchanged v1 search/economic contract except for the approved successor identity, epoch, and structural contamination gate.

If the successor runtime implementation is not merged before `2026-09-16T13:45:00Z`, do not backdate the epoch. Stop and preregister a later wholly future epoch instead.

No model fitting. No final-holdout access or evaluation. No model activation, paper activation, production deployment/restart/migration, geographic bypass, live trading, automatic promotion, or money-limit change is authorized by this step.
